502,EMAILED,I would replay the tone pattern in my head over and over again. That made it a lot easier.
507,EMAILED,"I remember I would memorize the tones in a make-shift ""melodic"" sense, like I would sing it to myself without humming or making any audible sound, essentially just emulating the tones in my mind. I would then use the created melody in my head to determine which tones of HML came at which points in time. I would also move my head in a motion correlating to the pitch of the tone (up/right for H, middle for M, down/left for L) in order to also make use of muscle memory for better memorization/regurgitation of the ex"
510,EMAILED,"During this portion of theexperiment I mainly used one strategy. I assigned each tone (H,M,L) a finger on my left hand (index, middle, ring) and tapped out the pattern of tones I recognized with each corresponding finger. I was able to complete the math problems while still remembering and adding to the pattern I was recording in my left hand. I found this strategy to work very well."
511,EMAILED,"As far as remembering the tones, I used my hands to remind myself which direction the tones went. For example: for the higher tones I pointed up, for the middle tones I pointed straight, and for the lower tones I pointed down. When I did the math equations, I was able to remember my hand patterns much better than I could remember the notes alone."
512,EMAILED,I would try to use as little brain power as possible to solve the math problem then say the answer in my head over and over while also trying to remember the pitch.
514,EMAILED,The main strategy I remember using was to remember each note and treat it like i was creating a melody note by note and just adding onto the melody with each question.
516,EMAILED,"Well that's incredibly unfortunate! My response was something along the lines of: I assigned each of my fingers on my left hand a pitch and tried to recall the order in which I tapped them after answering the math problems. I also tried recognizing patterns within the organization of pitches, as in it follows an ascending to depending pattern or whatever else."
534,EMAILED,"I tried to continuously repeat the words ""hi"", ""lo"" and ""mid"" (like a chant somewhat) in the correct pattern of the tones, adding on each time I heard a new tone. I also sometimes tried to imagine them visually as a high dot, a middle dot, and a low dot and would sort of –hop” from one to the other in my brain and create a path that represented the tone orders. I tried to keep these things continuously on a loop in the back of my head while trying to use as little of my focus as possible to answer the math problems and still get them right."
535,EMAILED,"I just sang the notes to myself, and came up with rhymes to remember the sequences sometimes. With the math, I just made sure not to overthink what I was doing."
537,EMAILED,"I made a finger stand for each high, low, or medium sound, and I would move my finger in a different position every time the pitch was played, to remember the number of times each pitch was played. Then I just focused on memorizing the order of the tunes. "
546,EMAILED,I would just remember the first letter of each tone type and keep repeating that in my head as I solved the math problems.
547,EMAILED,"A few strategies I used in the experiment were audiating the pitches in my head as if i were simply remembering my favorite song as i did the math. It was very relaxed as to avoid the stress of ""trying"" to remember something."
549,EMAILED,Some strategies I used for remembering tone while solving math equations were repeating the tones in order in my head over and over until I came to the screen where I input them and did so to the best of my knowledge.
551,EMAILED,I believe in that task I assigned a letter to each tone and was able to keep track of the pattern in my head. Audiating the pitches while repeating the pattern was also very helpful.
555,EMAILED,I remember using my fingers to represent low middle and high tones and then created a pattern by tapping the corresponding finger to the note it represented when I heard the tones being played. While I had that pattern I solved the math problems like normal in the midst of it
