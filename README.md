# tSpanResponseCleaner

This script will take the raw tSpan data, extract the responses with participant numbers, remove duplicates, "clean" those responses (i.e. remove all of the extraneous E-Prime info like [SPACE] and [ENTER]), bind emailed responses by participant number, bind responses to original data set, insert column for notes to identify type of response as "no response", "emailed response, "response", and "e-prime error"
